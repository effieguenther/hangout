# Let's Hangout

An AI-powered assistant that relieves the mental load of making plans with your friends. 

### The problem

It's exhausting to maintain a social life as an adult, especially in NYC. Your friends are scattered amonst the 5 boroughs, and making plans is an endless loop of "Where should we go?" and "When are you free?" This app aims to make it as simple as tapping a few buttons.
